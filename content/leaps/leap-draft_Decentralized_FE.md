When opening a pull request to submit your LEAP, please use an abbreviated title in the filename, `leap-draft_title_abbrev.md`. The title should be 44 characters or less.-->

## Simple Summary
<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Simply describe the outcome the proposed changes intends to achieve. This should be non-technical and accessible to a casual community member.-->
A proposal to distribute 400,000 LYRA to Kwenta DAO, incentivizing its hosting of Lyra interface on Optimism network for six month.

## Abstract
<!--A short (~200 word) description of the proposed change, the abstract should clearly describe the proposed change. This is what *will* be done if the LEAP is implemented, not *why* it should be done or *how* it will be done. If the LEAP proposes deploying a new contract, write, "we propose to deploy a new contract that will do x".-->
As the first interface deployer, Kwenta would receive priority support and incentives to host a Lyra interface and support updates for six months. In addition, the user interface will be rebranded as `Kwenta` instead of `Lyra` with an additional label `powered by Lyra`. 

## Motivation
<!--This is the problem statement. This is the *why* of the LEAP. It should clearly explain *why* the current state of the protocol is inadequate.  It is critical that you explain *why* the change is needed, if the LEAP proposes changing how something is calculated, you must address *why* the current calculation is innaccurate or wrong. This is not the place to describe how the LEAP will address the issue!-->
For the duration of the agreement, Kwenta DAO would bear sole responsibility for the operation of the interface and take all regulatory risks in connection with the activities and services Kwenta supports. However, Kwenta DAO would not charge any fees for users accessing the Lyra interface.

## Specification
<!--The specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature, there are five sections
1. Overview
2. Rationale
3. Technical Specification
4. Test Cases
5. Configurable Values
-->

### Overview
<!--This is a high level overview of *how* the LEAP will solve the problem. The overview should clearly describe how the new feature will be implemented.-->
To support the decentralized hosting service long-term, Lyra DAO needs individual entities to maintain the user interface. Therefore, this LEAP proposes the establishment of a collaboration between Lyra DAO and Kwenta DAO to execute the pilot hosting.

### Technical Specification
<!--The technical specification should outline the public API of the changes proposed. That is, changes to any of the interfaces Lyra currently exposes or the creations of new ones.-->
- The Lyra user interface will be rebranded as `Kwenta` instead of `Lyra`. 
- The label `powered by Lyra` will be presented on the UI to clarify the distinction. 

### Configurable Values
<!--Please list all values configurable under this implementation.-->
```
The Length of the hosting period = 6 months
The reward amount for the hosting = 400,000 LYRA
```
